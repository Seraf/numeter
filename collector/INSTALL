# Needed requirements : 
    * numeter-common
    * python-redis
    * redis >= 2.4.15

# Optional requirements :
    * python-mysql if you want to use MySQL to store hosts list.

# Setup the Collector

You need to setup a crontab for it. For example every 5 minutes:
    */5 * * * *  root  /opt/numeter/numeter-collector

You need to write a configuration file. Default is:
    /etc/numeter/numeter_collector.cfg

# Python Redis

For Debian :
    apt-get install python-redis

From sources :
    git clone https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py
    cd redis-py
    python setup.py install

# Python MySQL

You need to uncomment the "import MySQLdb" on numeter_collector.py script. You also need to install python-mysqldb
For debian :
    apt-get install python-mysqldb

# Redis > 2:1.2.6-1

For Debian Squeeze:
    echo "deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

Installation : 
    apt-get install -t squeeze-backports redis-server

# Configure the poller-list

## poller-list stored in a file

For an host (10.0.0.1) without password (on Redis), just add it's ip:
    10.0.0.1

For the same host with a password on Redis
    10.0.0.1:my_password

## poller-list stored in mysql

You have to setup the query for getting the host list in the numeter_collector.cfg file.
    host_list_mysql_query = select name,password from table_name;

Table example:
+----+-------------+----------+
| id | name        | password |
+----+-------------+----------+
|  3 | 10.66.6.216 | password |    <- valid
|  4 | 10.66.6.217 |          |    <- not valid
|  5 | 10.66.6.215 | NULL     |    <- not valid
+----+-------------+----------+

You can also use a list without any password, in this case don't create a column for password :
+----+-------------+
| id | name        |
+----+-------------+
|  3 | 10.66.6.216 |
|  4 | 10.66.6.217 |
|  5 | 10.66.6.215 |
+----+-------------+

If you want to use a single password for every hosts, you can setup directly like in the configuration file:
    host_list_mysql_query = select name,(@password:='password') from hosts;
